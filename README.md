This is effectively three classes Point, Path and Queue.
Created using composition.

Composition allows for protected (hidden) methods.

Points has no protect methods at the second
so add one 

  const hide = () => console.log("Hidden")
  
Now put it to use in two of the public methods

   const dump = () => {
       hide()
       return `aPoint ${row} ${column}`
   }
    
   const dumpToArray = () => {
    hide()
    return [row, column]
   }
   
Exercising dump and dumpToArray shows
hide is being executed. Calls to just
hide fail 

var p = Point(4,5)
console.log(p.dump())
p.hide() //does not work


It does not allow chaining as with the inheritance
version
 
var p = Path(Point(4,5),Point(6,7))
p.addPoint(Point(77,88))
p.dumpToArray()
p.addPoint(Point(1,2)).addPoint(Point(3,7)) //does not work
